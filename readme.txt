no longer developing/supporting this fork. 
The theme should still work without major issues (in the usual case anyways) for SM5 Beta 4 or newer.

===============================================================================
==Introduction==
ultralight is a bare-bones StepMania theme. The name was taken from a theme from
an abandoned fork of StepMania, and the theme itself is a pastiche of a few
StepMania themes (mainly PROPELA's step minor, with elements/ideas from my other
themes filling in the rest).

==Known Issues/To-Do Items==
[General]
* Online isn't done. Not by a long shot. This has a lot to do with me disliking
  the current state of online gameplay in StepMania.
* The Lifebar on Gameplay doesn't work in DirectX for some weird reason.
* This hasn't actually been tested with StepMania 5 beta 2, as I no longer keep
  up with StepMania development. Please report any problems in IRC, if you can
  manage to find me. DO NOT post them on the bugtracker, because the bugtracker
  isn't for dealing with third party themes (which ultralight is one of).

==PAQ (Possibly Asked Questions)==
Q: What's the history of this theme?
A: ultralight originally started out as the default theme for StepMania
   Frankencode, a now-abandoned StepMania fork that never saw the light of day.
   Some of the graphics are taken from the original theme.

Q: What's with that bar on the bottom of the title menu?
A: Test code that I ended up liking a lot. If you sit back far enough and
   imagine, it looks like people walking. (to me, anyways.)

Q: Hey this looks like step minor somewhat...
A: Not a question, but I'll field it. ultralight wasn't originally meant to be
   like that. In fact, the original design wasn't ever completed, so I decided
   to take step minor's interface and use it as a guide, changing things up
   when I felt like it.

Q: Is this theme compatible with StepMania 5 Tournament Edition?
A: Currently, no. A lot of changes need to be made before ultralight can be
   considered a StepMania 5 TE-compatible theme.

As stated above, there is no copyright on this theme, you may do whatever you
want with it. This includes using the graphics, metrics, or Lua code.

Though it isn't required, if you use parts of ultralight in your theme, it would
be nice if you let me know. (I like StepMania theming and want to see it grow.)
