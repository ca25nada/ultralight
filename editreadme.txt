Supported Version(s): StepMania 5 Beta 4
Last Update: Dec 9th 2014
====================================

Known Issues:

[General] The final score shows up as a AAA anyway after hitting a mine while the scoregraph shows otherwise:
- Stepmania 5 (for some reason) unlike 3.9, awards AAA score even when mines are hit. The DP score however, will still drop (by 8 on default) resulting in the discrepancy.

[General] 2P and other game modes don't work
- oop. (it might run but 2P support is the last thing on my todo list atm)

FAQ:

How to setup ingame speed change:
The speed up/down are each mapped to <EffectUp> and <EffectDown> respectively. Map those keys in config key/joy mappings and press them to change speed during gameplay.

How to use ScoreStatus
Map and press and hold down <Select> key at ScreenSelectMusic.

Speedmods do not load from speedmods.txt:
The speedmods are no longer loaded from that file as it is replaced by jousway's speedmod system. (annnd soon to be reverted back to default because they added something similar for b4)
